FAAN was voted Ecuador's Best Charity and Animal Shelter in 2023 by Gringo Post and has been working tirelessly this past year to raise funds to build the new shelter and move the dogs to their new home by the end of the year.

The shelter is part of the holistic strategy of the organization that includes evidence-based prevention strategies, rescue, adoption, and education.

The mission of the foundation is to make Cuenca known as the City that Cares about animal welfare.
