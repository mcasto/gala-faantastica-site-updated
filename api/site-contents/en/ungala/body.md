<div class='text-h2'>You're Invited!</div>
<div class='text-h4 my-4'>To FAANs UnGala Gala with a Special Surprise Announcement!
</div>

<div class="text-h6 mt-4">Look at it this way ...</div>

  - You love dogs but hate to dress up for a fancy party
  - You're traveling and not in Cuenca for FAAN's fundraising event of the year for the building of our new animal shelter
  - Or, you just love dogs, and you love a challenge ...

<div class="mt-4">
Just donate to FAAN (Fundaci√≥n Familia Amor Animal) for what you would have normally spent on a Gala FAAN-TASTICA ticket ... That way you will get the evening to yourself in your jammies while still supporting the building of the most modern animal shelter in South America.
</div>


While we will miss you, we will send you a virtual ticket to the FAAN UnGala Gala with your ticket _not_ to attend with full bragging rights.

But there's more! Our generous FAAN Mystery Donor has put forth yet another challenge to animal lovers in Ecuador and around the World to help us build the new home for the dogs.

Our Mr. X will double your donation and ticket for the UnGALA Gala for the dogs with 100% of your donation going toward the building of the new shelter!

<div class='text-h4 mb-2'>Wowza! Bowza! Double Your Impact!</div>

Donate $50, and Mr. X will double that to $100, granting you a place on our donor wall among FAAN's Bronze Circle of Benefactors.

Donate $250, and Mr. X will double that to $500 granting you a place on our donor wall among FAAN's Silver Circle of Benefactors.

Donate $500, and Mr. X will double that, making you a member of FAAN's Gold Circle of Benefactors.

Of course, you can donate more, and Mr. X will match that generous gift too!

Write us at <a href="mailto:info@FAANecuador.org">info@FAANecuador.org</a> for your UnGALA GALA virtual ticket. Let us know we won't see you there, but you have a gift for the dogs. Please indicate the amount of your gift and payment method. Remember, our Mr. X will double your donation through the end of October up to $20,000!

Good News if you can't attend Gala FAAN-TASTICA, you can still get in on our Auction Palooza with a few auction items available online, meaning you can enter your bids fromm anywhere. Guess what, those bids will _also_ be doubled for the dogs of FAAN!
